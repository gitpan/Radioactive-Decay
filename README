NAME
    Radioactive::Decay - allow scalar values to decay over time

SYNOPSIS
      use Radioactive::Decay;

      my $halflife = 10;
      tie my $var, $Radioactive::Decay, $halflife;

      $var = 40;
      sleep 10;
      print $var;  # 20
      sleep 10;
      print $var;  # 10

DESCRIPTION
    This allows you to tie a scalar variable so that it will decay over
    time.

    For example, if you set a half-life of 30 seconds, then a variable which
    is set to 100 now will be 25 in a minute's time.

    We're sure there are all manner of useful applications for this, and
    hopefully someone will let us know what they are.
